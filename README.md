Perfect — let’s build a **complete, production-ready Streamlit ML training app**.

This app will:

✅ Upload any CSV
✅ Select target column
✅ Auto-detect task (classification / regression)
✅ Preprocess (missing values, encoding, scaling)
✅ Train multiple ML models
✅ Compare metrics
✅ Visualize results
✅ Show feature importance
✅ Download predictions

This fits very well with your ML-heavy workflow and portfolio style.
